The main will be used primarily for any code/adjustments made to the main program of the game.

Other branches will be made in the future for any animations / art

Dont forget to click commit changes the work will show in whichever BRANCH you decide to put it in

** Your name will be next to the work that you have submitted therefore there is no need to have your name at the end of things **

Always test any code or animations before submitting and MAKE SURE that the project is UPDATED with any prior code / animations BEFORE submission

*** If you havent updated the project your code may interfere with prior code and muddle it up ***

If i personally need to accept a request to change the code i will try to change it so anyone can change / update

If NOT then I (Kyler) will let everyone know of my schedule of that week since I do work and university I may not see this till later at night
